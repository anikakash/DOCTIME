## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**
- **HTML & CSS**
- **Flexbox (CSS)** for layout structuring and responsiveness

## Features Implemented

### **1. Responsive Design**

- Built with Flexbox to ensure a seamless user experience across different screen sizes.
- Optimized for both mobile and tablet devices.

### **2. Review Section with JSON Data Handling**

- Reviews are dynamically updated by simply adding new entries to a JSON file.
- No manual modifications to the HTML structure are required.

### **3. Review Slider with Circular Navigation**

- Implemented a review slider where users can navigate through reviews.
- Used modular arithmetic (`mod` operations) to create seamless navigation:
  - Clicking "Next" on the last review loops back to the first review.
  - Clicking "Previous" on the first review loops back to the last review.

### **4. Fully Responsive Footer**

- Designed to adapt smoothly to different screen sizes.
- Ensured proper alignment and readability across devices.
- One of the most challenging aspects of the project.
